Montagues and capulets is a strategy game where you battle against a rival house.<br>
The objective of the game is to kill the other house's king. The opponent and you take turns
making attacks against the each other's armies. You may only make attacks with cards that are exposed e.g. they must 
have no other cards in front of them when facing the enemy. After a card's hp drops below zero, that cards is dead
and no longer in play.<br>
You can select which card to attack and defend with by pressing the key that corresponds with that card. 
The keys are as follows:<br>
2: 2,   
3: 3,     
4: 4,     
5: 5,     
6: 6<br>
7: 7,     
8: 8,     
9: 9,     
10: 0,     
A: a<br>
J: j,     
Q: q,     
K: k<br>
SPACEBAR clears the keys cards you've chosen for your move. ENTER makes an attack with the cards you've picked.<br>
Killing an enemy card with your attack will grant you a potion. When prompted, press the key to which you would like to apply the potion.
